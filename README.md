**Electric Vehicle Data Analysis Project**

This project analyzes a dataset of electric vehicles to uncover trends in range, pricing, energy consumption, and performance using Python.

**Tools Used**
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scipy

**Tasks Covered**
1. Filter EVs by price and range
2. Group by manufacturer and compute battery averages
3. Detect outliers in energy consumption
4. Visualize battery vs. range
5. Build a recommendation system
6. Perform hypothesis testing (Tesla vs. Audi)

**Files Included**
- `Electric Vehicles Project.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with full analysis
- `FEV-data-Excel.xlsx` – Dataset

**Summary**
This project demonstrates real-world data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and statistical testing on EV market data.
